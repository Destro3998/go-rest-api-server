# Go REST API Server (CRUD)

I made this simple and modular RESTful API built using **Go (Golang)** and the **Gorilla Mux** router for praticse purpose on my backend skills and knowledge.


## Features

- RESTful API with endpoints for CRUD Operations
- Built using Go's `net/http` package and `gorilla/mux` for clean routing
- Modular folder structure (handlers, router, models)
- JSON request/response support
- Tested with Postman to verify the workings

## Installation & Setup

**Clone the repo** and **Run the Server**

- I have used go verion [1.23.1] here. Install or check your version using [go version] in terminal
- run: go run main.go
- API will be available at http://localhost:8080
- I have used POSTMAN application to run and test the CRUD operation on this server.
